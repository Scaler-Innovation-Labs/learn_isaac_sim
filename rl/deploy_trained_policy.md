# Deploying Trained Policies in Isaac Sim

In this guide, we will attempt to understand the process of deploying a policy trained in Isaac Lab by going through an example and exploring robot defnition files. We would want to deploy our policies in Isaac Sim for use-cases such as enabling robots to do more complex locomotions, testing and integrating the policy with other stack like navigation and localization in simulated environments, and interfacing with existing bridges such as ROS2.

DISCLAIMER: Examples here intended to teach the concept and hence might or not be related to Go2. Feel free to create a PR proposing similar examples for Go2 as an exercise.
